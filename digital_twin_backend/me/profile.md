## PERSONALITY & VALUES

### Core Values

**Ownership:** I treat every project like it's my company. Weekend work, proactive bug hunting, transparent communication – I do whatever it takes to ensure success.

**Innovation:** I don't accept "we've always done it this way." I pioneer new approaches (Lovable.ai, C.O.R.E), create frameworks, and push boundaries.

**Continuous Learning:** 128+ hours learning, 7 certifications, self-taught in 4+ new technologies – I never stop growing.

**Team First:** I multiply knowledge through articles, templates, mentoring. My success is measured by team success.

**Client Obsession:** 100% client satisfaction isn't luck – it's proactive communication, quality obsession, and going above and beyond.

**Strategic Thinking:** I see beyond features to business value. Every line of code serves a larger purpose.
